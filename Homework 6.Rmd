### Problem 1


#### Reading in the data:

```{r}
homicide_data = read_csv(file = "./data/homicide_data.csv")
```


Cleaning the data:

```{r}
homicide_data_clean = 
  homicide_data %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ',')) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX" | city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" | 
         city_state != "Kansas City, MO" | city_state != "Tulsa, AL") 
  
```
